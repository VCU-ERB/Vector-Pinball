#Task 1 Make Flipper Object
-------------------------------- Instructions Start Here --------------------------------
Goal: The project aims to make a flipper object and enhance the flipper to make it an object
      to imitate what it would look like in real life. Currently the flipper looks like a
      line and doesn't look interesting for the players as the other objects.

Steps
1. Open the github folder in Android Studio and check that you have a build to launch the app
   in a virtual environment
2. Go to assets -> tables and open table1.json
3. Scroll down and look for FlipperElement, now you will see two FlipperElements for the two
   flippers
4. Make another two flipper elements with the same properties as the two that are already defined
5. Change the y-axis by decreasing 0.1 from each new FlipperElements
6. Click the play button on the top right and wait for the virtual device to run the app
   then check the changes on the flipper object

How To Check: The flipper object will add height to make it look thicker and have similar
              properties as the objects in the game
